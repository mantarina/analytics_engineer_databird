This model generates a RFM analysis, including the following metrics for each customer :
- Recency (R): number of days since the last purchase (reference last purchase compared to last date in database: 31/12/2018)
- Frequency (F): number of orders until 31/12/2018
- Monetary (M): total revenue generated by the customer until 31/12/2018
Each dimension is scored from 1 to 3 (1 = high, 5 = low).

the purpose of an RFM analysis is precisely to enable concrete, highly operational business actions that are easy to implement in order to:
- increase revenue,
- reduce churn,
- improve campaign targeting,
- boost purchase frequency,
- activate the right customers at the right moment.
